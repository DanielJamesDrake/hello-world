# hello-world
I have no idea what I am doing

Salutations,

I am pretty new to coding, but have decided that 31 is old enough to get off my ass and teach myself how to make the games I've always wanted to. So now I'm catapaulting down a rabbit hole of new software, new ways of thinking, and relearning long division so I can understand jump physics. Happy to have gotten over enough of my crap to be here; looking forward to the future.

Dan
